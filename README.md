# Jukeboxd
## A collaborative album rating board

This project was born out of a desire to create an equivalent of Letterboxd, a social network which allows users to rate and review movies, for music. Though the scope of the project changed throughout the previous 24 hours, we were ultimately able to create a social network allowing users to rate and review albums while sharing their opinions to a wider audience.

Jukeboxd allows users to search up albums and leave ratings on a five-star scale along with written reviews. After the reviews are posted, they are visible to all users both on the page for the album and on the homepage where all reviews are posted, with the most recent reviews visible first. All reviews are anonymous, eliminating the need for an account system.

The frontend of the project is written in Next.js, the massive database of albums comes from the MusicBrainz API, and the reviews are stored in a Supabase backend. Throughout this project, we learned a great deal about integrating APIs with a website as well as how to use databases to our advantage.

We believe that this will be a fun applet for small communities and hope to make it available to the hackers so they can share what they've been listening to while coding hard, as well as judge each other's tastes.
